  <p>
    <strong>Hi! My name's Nate, and I'm an internet addict</strong>. They say acceptance is the
    first step on the road to recovery. <i>But seriously</i> --
    I love creating new ways of communicating and
    understanding information. I've been learning and building on the web for
    about as long as it's existed as a publicly accessible resource. I first heard
    the sound of a modem connecting to the internet back in 1989 when I was about
    six years old, and I've been hooked ever since.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>After five years of honing my skills as a professional developer</strong>,
    I'm currently focusing on
    deepening my knowledge of geographical information systems, bidirectional
    real time communication channels (primarily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" target="_blank">WebSocket</a>), and new kinds of web server software like Node.js to see if I
    can play a part in shaping the next generation of web applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>I grew up in Los Angeles, California and Paris, France</strong>
    and had the good
    fortune of growing up trilingual, learning English, French and Spanish as a
    young boy. My Spanish isn't as good as it used to be but I'm still fully
    fluent in French, and I'm always up for practicing or learning a new language.
    I studied Philosophy and Linguistics at UC Santa Cruz and Web Design and
    Interactive Media at the Art Institute of Portland, earning a Bachelor of Arts
    from the former and a Bachelor of Science from the latter.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>I've been living in Portland, Oregon for close to three years</strong>
    and I'm
    thoroughly enjoying the good coffee, beer and books and the blossoming
    technology industry that can be found here.

    If you need to get in touch with me I'm active on
    <a href="http://twitter.com/n8ji">twitter</a> and IRC (you can sometimes
    find me at #pdxtech on irc.freenode.net as @ngoldman) and I also check my
    <a href="mailto:nate@ngoldman.me">email</a> regularly. If I don't respond
    right away, I'm probably buried under a pile of work, but I'll get back to
    you as soon as I can. Thanks for visiting!
