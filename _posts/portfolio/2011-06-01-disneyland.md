This was an early project I worked on while I was a front end intern at
[Dachis Group](http://dachisgroup.com) in Portland. I took an old Facebook tab
written in [FBML](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fbml) and
converted it to a full-fledged Sinatra application hosted on a cloud server.
I did some further work on a sister application when Disney hosted a
"Moms Panel" using Disneyworld's facebook tab as a primary point of entry. That
event saw well over 100,000 visitors in a short period of time, testing the
limits of our servers and the quality of our code.
