Martin is a Ruby/Sinatra web application boilerplate optimized for immediate
deployment to Heroku. A lot of the code comes from Kyle Drake's
Sammy Davis Junior boilerplate. This project was my attempt to distill all of
the essentials of web application development with Sinatra that I had learned
while working at [Dachis](http://www.dachisgroup.com/)
into a useful contribution to the open source community.
This was a group project for Chuck Vose's Rapid Web Development class in the
Fall of 2011. The concept I came up with was to develop a cloud service that
allows students to track classes, assignments and files. The motivation was to
create a single site that consolidated the many disparate online services
students often use, allowing them to keep track of important information related
to school in one place on the web.

I acted as project manager, working with four other students to build a
prototype of this service in four weeks. We used Ruby on Rails for the back end,
the paperclip gem to handle file versions, and pushState with jquery-pjax to
make the application as quick and seamless as possible. We also had two
designers working on wireframing, site structure and iconography.

The code is open source and is available [here](https://github.com/ngoldman/martin).
