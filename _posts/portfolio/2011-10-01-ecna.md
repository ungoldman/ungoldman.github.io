Our team of students was put in touch with the East Columbia Neighborhood
Assocation by our instructor, Griffin Walker. They were in need of a site to
distribute information and promote the welfare of their neighborhood on the web.
I took the role of project manager, leading a team of four other students to
design and build a site over the course of two terms. We did a lot of field
research, meeting with members of the assocation and residents of the
neighborhood to properly assess what they needed in a website. We designed
and built the site over the course of six months and were treated to a launch
party by the ECNA in September of 2011.

The site was built using Drupal. With a lot of hard work from our back end
developer Scott Elwood, we built a robust custom administration section to make
it easy for members of the assocation to manage their own content.
