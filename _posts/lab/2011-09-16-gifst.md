Gif.st was a project for Peter Wooley's advanced scripting class in the Summer
of 2011. I used the concept of a simple gif sharing service to experiment with
handling file uploads, third-party authentication through twitter, AJAX and
HTML5 pushState. The back end was built using Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, and
Amazon's S3 cloud storage service, and the application was hosted on Heroku.
The application also featured a URL shortening service.
