Tetromino was a team project for Peter Wooley's Node.js class during the Summer
of 2012. Our team decided to create a real-time multiplayer tetris clone using
WebSockets and HTML5 Canvas technology. I led the development effort along
with Sean Harvey while Chan Park took care of the design.

Designing and coding the logic for a working tetris clone that any number of
players could play at the same time was extremely challenging, but we managed
to get it done in four weeks. We also used CouchDB, a NoSQL database, to manage
users and high scores, and built a working scoreboard as well as an HTML5 mp3
player for musical accompaniment. Overall it was a great project that showed us
the strengths of Node.js and got me excited about building more browser-based
games in the future.
